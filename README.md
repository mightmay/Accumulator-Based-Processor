# Accumulator-Based-Processor

SEE DETAILED INFORMATION IN Information.docx

In this project we have developed an Accumulator Based Processor. This processor “Hybrid Architecture” because it is the “Accumulator (ACC) based type ISA” and it is also implemented as a two stage pipelined architecture. The first stage was used to fetch the instructions from the Instruction RAM. The second stage was used to execute the instructions. Our processor used separate Instruction RAM and Data RAM to support the hybrid pipelined ACC Architecture. To get the additional project points, we also developed all of the other enhancing features such as Cache, MHVPI, assembler, two-way handshake, etc.
